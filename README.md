### Intention

This website is a `fictional website` and created as prject number one of Code Instituteâ€™s Full Stack Software Developer Course.

When planning what to do for this project. There where a few things i wanted to achive.

* To make a site that was easy to navigate and easy to read.

* Have a clear theme with the styles, colors and fonts i used.

* A navigation bar that was intuitive to use while still looking good.

* A responsive gallery page
