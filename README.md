### Color Scheme

* I chose to use three different colors on the website. Grey, Blue and White. The Grey is supposed to represent the arctic nights. The blue represents the sky in daytime. The white represents the snow. (The specific white i used is actually called "Snow")

#fffafa - White (HEX-color)

#0c6af7 - Blue (Hex color)

* Navigation bar used for mobile on the Home Page - Containing buttons for `About`, `Destinations`, `Contact`. But not a button for `Gallery`, for the reason that i couldn't get it to look good. So to get to the gallery on mobile you will have to use the button thats located in the `Destinations` section of the site.

### Gallery button

* A button located at the bottom of the `Destinations` section of the site to access the gallery page.
