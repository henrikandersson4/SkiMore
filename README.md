### Intention

This website is a `fictional website` and created as project number one of Code Instituteâ€™s Full Stack Software Developer Course.

This website is created with the knowledge I gained from the `HTML` and `CSS` modules of the Course.

When planning what to do for this project. There where a few things i wanted to achive.

* To make a site that was easy to navigate and easy to read.

* Have a clear theme with the styles, colors and fonts i used.

* A navigation bar that was intuitive to use while still looking good.

* A responsive gallery page

## Design

### Color Scheme

* I chose to use three different colors on the website. Grey, Blue and White. The Grey is supposed to represent the arctic nights. The blue represents the sky in daytime. The white represents the snow. (The specific white i used is actually called "Snow")

#fffafa - White (HEX-color)

![Picture of white box](/assets/images/white-box.png)

#303030 - Grey (HEX-color)

![Picture of grey box](/assets/images/grey-box.png)

#0c6af7 - Blue (Hex color)

![Picture of blue box](/assets/images/blue-box.png)

### Fonts

I used three different fonts for the website. `Montserrat` for the logo in the header, `Ubuntu` for all `H1-H6` headings and `Catamaran` for all other text on the site.

## Features

### Navigation bar

* Navigation bar used on Home Page on desktop - Containing buttons for `About`, `Destinations`, `Contact`, `Gallery`.

![Picture of nav bar on Home Page](/assets/images/nav-bar.png)

* Navigation bar used for gallery page on desktop and mobile - Containing only the `SkiMore` logo beacuase the only way to go next is back to the Home Page.

* Navigation bar used for mobile on the Home Page - Containing buttons for `About`, `Destinations`, `Contact`. But not a button for `Gallery`, for the reason that i couldn't get it to look good. So to get to the gallery on mobile you will have to use the button thats located in the `Destinations` section of the site.

### Gallery button

* A button located at the bottom of the `Destinations` section of the site to access the gallery page.

### Contact Form

* The Contact form is `refreshed` when clicking on the `Submit` button. It will also show the user that he or she needs to fill in all of the input fields that are `* required` with a warning text.

## Testing

* All pages have been tested across all screen sizes for a responsive experience. 

* I used validators to test both the code of both the HTML and CSS. I did this with the use of `W3C validator` for HTML and `Jigsaw Validator` for CSS.

* I made sure that the website looks good down to a screen size of 320px wide.

* All links to external websites open in a new browser window.

* The Submit button in the Contact form shows a hover effect when hovered with a mouse.

* The website is also tested for accessibility using `Chrome lighthouse dev tool`. (See results below)
